# PROXIMUS A2P SMS API

A simple wrapper of the Proximus API to send and receive texts. Everything is based on the documentation as found [here](https://proximusapi.enco.io/asset/sms/apiconsole).

## FUNCTIONALITIES

- Outbound

As u can see i've only wrapped the part responsible of outbound texts, as these are the only routes i currently need for my project. lol.
